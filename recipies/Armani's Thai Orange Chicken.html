        <li>3 carrots, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup peanuts</li>
        <li>⅓ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir carrots, ginger, and garlic until carrots are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer carrot mixture to a bowl. Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the same skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir chicken in the hot olive oil until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add carrot mixture, water, peanuts, orange juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, and red pepper flakes to chicken; stir to combine. Cover and simmer until sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove about 1/4 cup sauce from the skillet; whisk in cornstarch until dissolved and sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour cornstarch mixture back into chicken and sauce; cook until sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 more minutes.</li>
      </ol>
