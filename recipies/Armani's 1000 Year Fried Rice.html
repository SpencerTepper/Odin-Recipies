    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hibachi-style fried rice recipe is quick and easy and sure to be a big hit.
         One of my favorite parts of hibachi is the fried rice and I was determined to make it at home. 
         I enjoy using leftover teriyaki chicken in my fried rice, but you can use any meat you want or no meat at all! 
         With or without chicken it is equally as delicious and a great side dish. 
         You can use more or less garlic, depending on your personal preference.
